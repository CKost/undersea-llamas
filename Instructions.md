## Objective ##
Undersea Llamas is an undersea exploration game. The player will move around on the game map, looking for treasure. He has a set amount of lives at the beginning of the game. As he moves around the map, he will come across various treasure chests containing treasure, enemies, or riddles. The player has the option of opening a treasure chest that he sees, or leaving it safely closed. The player wins the game by collecting a set amount of treasure without losing his last life.

## Gameplay ##
The player begins a game by clicking the “Create World” or “Basic World” button. He then moves his llama in any direction within a set boundary on the game board. The llama is moved by using the keyboard keys “w,” “a,” “s,” and “d.” If the player's llama is in the same cell as a treasure chest, he can open that treasure chest by typing the letter “o.” Inside the treasure chest is either treasure (to earn a random number of points), an enemy (which will lower the llama’s life level by one), or a riddle (which must be answered correctly to earn points). The player will lose the game if all of his lives are lost. The player’s number of points is slowly decremented throughout the game, so he must move around the board quickly enough to earn points before they drop to zero. He will win the game when a set amount of points is earned. The player can save the game’s current state with a .ulstate file extension when he clicks the “Save” button. He can load a previously saved game state by clicking the “Load” button. The “High Scores” button displays a list of the most recent scores, and the “Cheat Mode” button makes the game easier to play in various ways. (See “Levels” below.)

## Scoring ##
The player collects points by opening treasure chests that contain treasure, and by opening riddle chests and answering their questions correctly. Points will be subtracted based on elapsed time. Winning is achieved by earning enough total points.

## Levels ##
This game has two basic levels. The game’s “Basic World” button creates a hard-coded, standard level. The “Create World” button creates a randomly generated world that changes each time the button is clicked. Also, the "Cheat “Mode” button makes any level easier by stopping the cyclical time penalty, lowering the number of points needed to win, and making treasure chest contents identifiable before opening the chests.
